- Go to kohls.com and add at least 2 products to your cart. Then return to the home page.
- Write a JavaScript snippet that can be run in the console of the browser that does the following:
  - Extracts the number of items in the cart, the cart total, and the item images from the page. Store them in variables.
  - Creates a trigger that activates when the user scrolls into the bottom 10% of the page.
  - The trigger should show a centered overlay on top of the site that displays the information gathered above and two buttons:
    - one button should close the overlay
    - the other should take the user to the cart page
  - Behind the overlay add a semiÂ­-transparent black background that obscures the site.
  - The overlay should be able to trigger multiple times if dismissed.
- The overlay should have a style consistent with the website. Design matters.
